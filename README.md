# LuaLib
Lua 5.4.4, released on 13 Jan 2022 With A Simple CMakeList To Build it into a static Library

---
### Building
make sure you have cmake installed:

```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

if you have make installed then you can just run `make` and everything will be built (note this requires cmake too).

and you should have a `libLua544.a` or `libLua544.lib` (depending on the platform) in the `build` directory
